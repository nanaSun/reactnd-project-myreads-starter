# MyReads Project

It's an app which you can manager your books. There are 3 shelves, one for the book you are reading currently, one for the book you want to read, and last one for the book you have finished. 

You can move your book among these 3 shelves, but when you choose 'none' you will delete your book from the shelves.

If the book you need is not in shelves, you can search for the book by book's name. When you find the book, add the book to one of your shelves.

Download the project, and then runing `npm install`. After install running npm start, and then http://localhost:3000 will appear in your browser.
